title:  "T2TRG meeting in Paris!"
---

In parallel with the Hackathon, a Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG) physical interim meeting will take place on 21 May 2024, 17:00-18:45 in the Breakout room.

The Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG) investigates open research issues in turning a true "Internet of Things" into reality, an Internet where low-resource nodes ("things", "constrained nodes") can communicate among themselves and with the wider Internet, in order to partake in permissionless innovation.
The focus of the T2TRG is on issues that touch opportunities for standardization in the IETF, i.e., it starts at the adaptation layer connecting devices to IP, and ends at the application layer with architectures and APIs for communicating and making data and management functions (including security functions) available.
