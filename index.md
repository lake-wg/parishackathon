Welcome to the official page of **{{ site.title }}**.
The [Inria AIO](https://aio.inria.fr/team/) team is excited to be hosting this event and we are looking forward to welcoming you in the beautiful city of Paris!

The 2-day event takes place in **{{ site.location }}** at the premises of [FIAP](https://www.fiap.paris) on **{{ site.date }}**.

The idea is to simply mimic the basics of an IETF Hackathon - a room with large tables, sockets and Internet access.
Lunches will be provided by the organization.

The scope has been set to lightweight IoT security-related topics.
This includes, but is not limited to, interop testing and progressing the drafts related to the work of the IETF CoRE, ACE & LAKE working groups:

* Secure CoAP group communication and related techniques
* OSCORE enhancements or applications
* EDHOC including extensions and applications, EAP-EDHOC
* ACE profiles
* Lightweight certificate enrolment

The event is sponsored by Inria.
